Task 1 :
- It looks like after seeing the graph that the system is non linear as well as unstable, but the formation of sawtoot periodically make it look like a function with discounties (like with jumps). kind of an unstable oscillation, 
- interstingly as i increased the num of points i found its like a sinosodial behaviour , and at 50000 points it perfectly sure its a sine wave generator
