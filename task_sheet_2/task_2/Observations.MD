Considering my example 
- In the stable case, even though starting with X1 population with 150, X2 low with 50 and X3 medium with 100, the curves are some how settled and the same values of KP and KD leads to some balanced competitive pressure 
- In the Unstable case, as the KD area is larger the degration effect is much stronger and cam be called as less balnced wrt stable case.


In the Second Figure
- In the stable case , the P_kill is moderate and not too extreme 
- In the unstable case, the P_kill has bigger spikes and stringer asymmetry
